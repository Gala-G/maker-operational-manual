MakerDAO is a decentralized governance community that enables the generation of Dai, the worldâ€™s leading decentralized stablecoin.

The decentralized governance community of MakerDAO manages the generation of Dai through an embedded governance mechanism within the Maker Protocol.

From early adopters to MKR holders, ecosystem stakeholders, and community members, the Maker Community is an indispensable and critical part of the Maker system. In short, the Maker Community is MakerDAO.

MKR holders have the sole authority to enact changes to the system through voting.

## The Maker Protocol

The Maker Protocol is the set of smart contracts that make it possible to mint Dai.
The Maker Protocol was the first decentralized finance (DeFi) application to earn significant adoption and remains one of the largest decentralized applications (DAPPs) on the Ethereum blockchain.

All Dai is backed by a surplus of collateral that has been locked into audited and publicly viewable Ethereum smart contracts.
